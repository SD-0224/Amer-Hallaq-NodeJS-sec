I have worked in the construction industry for four years as a Mechanical Design Engineer. I'm a specialist in BIM engineering and digital transformation as I used to design and deliver 3D models of MEP elements. However, coding has always sparked my passion for software development and related topics. I started to learn coding to integrate my engineering experience into software development to increase my productivity and build eventually my product.

Time management and my ability to learn strengths have supported me in learning software development and achieving this goal. I have good knowledge and experience in both JavaScript and Python programming languages and their frameworks like React, Node.js, Django, and Flask. Recently, I joined TAP (Talent Acceleration Platform) that would enrich my knowledge and help me to connect with fast-growing international companies.

I'm looking to get hands-on experience in Back-End development and join a company where I can find an appropriate environment to employ my skills and knowledge, so finally I can make a significant contribution to their product.
