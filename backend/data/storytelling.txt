I'm Amer Hallaq, I have worked as a Mechanical Engineer for four years. However, coding has always sparked my passion for software development and related topics, and the fact that it overlaps with every major including engineering. I started to learn coding to enhance my productivity and integrate it with my engineering experience to build eventually my product.

Considering my time management and ability to learn strengths that have supported my learning journey and achieving this goal. I have good knowledge of JS and Python programming languages and their frameworks like node.js and Django.

I recently joined TAP to enrich my knowledge and help me to cinnect with fast-growing companies where I can employ and grow my skills so finally I make significant contribution to their product.
